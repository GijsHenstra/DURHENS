Dutch URban Environmental Numerical Simulation

Before running, create a new python 3.9.5 environment. Then, the required packages can be installed via 'pip install > requirements.txt'

To run (multiple) simulations, run the 'batch_run.py' file where you specify which folders to run in the list of 'scenario_folders'. In these folders there should be a 'config.yaml' file, similar as in the 'TU Delft demo' folder.
